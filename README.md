 - Assigned Microsoft 365 and SharePoint licenses to domain users
 - Verified user access by signing in with test accounts
 - Created a SharePoint Team Site using an onboarding template

 - Created documents with different permission levels
      1) Document 1: Admin‑only access
      2) Document 2: Edit access for selected users, read‑only for others
 - Tested all permissions by logging in as multiple users

## Skills demonstrated
- Microsoft 365 user provisioning
- SharePoint site creation and configuration
